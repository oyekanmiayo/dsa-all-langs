# Contribution Guide for data-structures-all-langs
Thank you for taking time out to learn the best practices for contributing to this repo! Your contributions will potentially help thousands of developers on their journeys to understand data structures intuitively. Please, read through carefully and feel free to open an issue if something is not clear.

# Guidelines
As a contributor you can:
- Implement a data structure in a language that doesn't exist
- Improve any implementation
- Improve the READMEs explaining any data structure (NO SPAMS, PLS)

## Adding/Editing a README
- Follow the [TEMPLATE-ONE](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs/blob/main/TEMPLATE-ONE.md) file for data structures with single implementations
- Follow the [TEMPLATE-TW0](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs/blob/main/TEMPLATE-TWO.md) file for data structures with multiple implementations

## Adding/Editing a Coding File
- Coding file should be created a directory that looks like `data-structures-all-langs/name.of.data.structure/programming.language/name.of.file`
- Mark yourself as the author at the top of the file like [this](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs/blob/main/stack/java/ArrayStack.java#L2). Find the best way to do this for the langauge you are using
- Add a comment explaining the parameters and the return type of each method
- Add driver code (i.e. code in the "main" function to test the implementation)
